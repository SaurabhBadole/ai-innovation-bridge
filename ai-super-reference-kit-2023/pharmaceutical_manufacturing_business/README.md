## What is "How it's Made with Intel"?

This “How it's made with Intel” comprises distinct product lifecycle components that have been re-imagined – transforming them from legacy to machine learning solutions powered by the Intel hardware and software AI stack. The enabling technology stack includes components across Intel’s software and hardware portfolio. Each lifecycle component starts with an AI Reference Kit that has been refactored to enable a pseudo-microservice architecture, making them easier to integrate into more complex applications. The integration of multiple kits, showcases how an integrated optimized solution could be made with intel components to address a particular industry challenge. 

## Available Product Lifecycle Solutions

- [Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Solution](Pharmaceutical_Product_Lifecycle_Solution)
- More coming soon...

## What comes with each Lifecycle Solution?

Each lifecycle solution comes with:
- AI/ML Source Code
- Documenation
- Docker Container Config Files
- FastAPI Endpoint Script
- Deployment Instructions on the Intel Developer Cloud
- Synthetic Data Generation Scripts (if applicable)
- Streamlit WebApp Frontend (if applicable)
- Makefile for easy deployment (if applicable)

## Frontend Prototypes
Using a low-code webapp framework like streamlit, allows us to bring the solutions to life. The streamlit frontend can be run directly on the localhost and let's you experience and test the functionality of each component. More importantly, it validates the integrated solution API archiecture allowing developers to build a simple prototype before investing in additional development.

## How to Contribute
If you want to contribute to this project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

### Contributing your own Lifecycle Solution
If you want to contribute a new solution, please open an issue and we will follow up with you ASAP!

### Implementing Patches and Bug Fixes

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
- Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the component has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!

If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code – not what you did to the code.
