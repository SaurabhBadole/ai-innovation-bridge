## Demand Forecasting Lifecycle Solution Component
The ability to forecast the demand and thus overcome the problems arising from its variability is one of the top challenges for Supply Chain Managers. When planning the production or the supply of shops, organizations are always managing a short blanket: producing/supplying more to avoid out of stocks implies spending more for production, transportation, and immobilized capital.

In this component of the "How it's Made with Intel" solution, we demonstrate one method where we can use AI and Intel AI Optimizations, such as Intel® Optimizations for Tensorflow,to construct a complex time series model for demand forecasting capable of spanning multiple products and stores all at once.

## Solution Architecture
To model the complex patterns that may be present when understanding product demand, it is often necessary to capture complicated mechanisms such as extended seasonality and long-term correlations, resulting in significant feature engineering to come to a good solution.  Modern AI solutions, such as Deep Neural Networks can drastically aid in this process by becoming automatic feature extractors where the explicit mechanisms do not need to be written down, but rather the AI is allowed to learn them from historical data.  

In this component, we follow this Deep Learning approach and demonstrate how to train and utilize a CNN-LSTM time series model, which takes in the last 130 days worth of sales data for a specific item at a specific store, to predict the demand 1 day ahead.  A trained model can then be used to predict the next days demand for every item and every store in a given catalog using only previous purchase data, on a daily basis. 

Broadly, we will tackle this problem using the following pipeline

> Historical Purchase Data => CNN-LSTM Training => CNN-LSTM Inference

Intel® Optimizations for Tensorflow include Intel oneDNN.  **By default, Intel oneDNN optimizations are enabled as of Tensorflow v2.9.** We will use these optimizations as part of this component.

#### Model Building Process with Intel® Optimizations

We first transform the input data to the regression format expected and feed this data into our CNN-LSTM model. **Intel® Optimizations for Tensorflow powered by Intel oneDNN are enabled by simply using Tensorflow >= v2.9. If Tensorflow >= 2.9 is used, no further code changes are required to utilize these optimizations.**

#### Model Inference with Intel® Optimizations

The saved model from the training process can be used to predict demand on new data of the same format.  This expects the previous 130 days sales counts. A multi-step ahead forecast can be generated by iterating this process, using predicted values as input and propagating forward though the model. **Intel® Optimizations for Tensorflow powered by Intel oneDNN are enabled by simply using Tensorflow >= v2.9. If Tensorflow >= 2.9 is used, no further code changes are required to utilize these optimizations.**
