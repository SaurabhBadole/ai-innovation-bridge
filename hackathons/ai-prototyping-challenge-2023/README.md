# Intel AI Reference Kit "Prototyping Challenge"

The AI Reference Kit Prototyping Challenge allows developers to compete and learn how to build practical AI applications using intel-optimized software on intel hardware platforms.  In this challenge, you assume the persona of a “Consulting AI Developer,” you are tasked with delivering a prototype application to a technology review board in just a few days.  The application must meet the following requirements:
- Must include at least one modular AI services based on a unique AI Reference Kit
- All functionality must be accessible and functional through a simple frontend
  - Frontend must communicate with the backend through an API framework, using HTTP Protocols
- All solution components must run in their own docker container as modular services
- Entire prototype must run on the Intel 4th Generation Xeon resources provided through the Intel Developer Cloud

# What are AI Reference Kits? 
In collaboration with Accenture*, Intel offers a series of downloadable AI reference kits to the open-source community to help enterprises accelerate their digital transformation journey. These kits are built upon the AI application tools that Intel provides to data scientists and developers.

## A Glimpse into the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Business AI Reference Kit Prototype

**Sample Prototype**: Explore a sample that integrates demand prediction, predictive maintenance, customer support chatbot, and visual QA/QC reference kits. These are refactored into pseudo-microservices crafted for a pharmaceutical product lifecycle narrative, complete with a Streamlit frontend. Use this as your architectural muse!

**Note**: Remember, this is a "hackathon out of the box". While it serves as a fantastic starting point, always refer to your specific hackathon's official rules for detailed guidelines.
