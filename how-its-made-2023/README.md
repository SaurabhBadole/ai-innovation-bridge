# Intel AI Hackathon: Reinvent With Intel Code Base

Welcome to the Intel AI Hackathon, where legacy meets machine learning. Over the span of three exhilarating days, utilize the "How it's Made with Intel" code base to craft revolutionary solutions, taking full advantage of Intel's pre-configured AI reference kits. 

## Dive In & Discover

Leverage over 30 AI reference kits, each tuned to perfection with Intel optimizations and designed for Intel Xeon CPU processors. Your challenge? Seamlessly integrate a minimum of two kits and pivot them into a two-part innovative solution.

**Example Solution**: Take the predictive maintenance for telephone lines and visual QA/QC reference kits, and transform them into a robotic arm maintenance combined with a product-specific visual QA/QC tool, aiming to revolutionize production line automation.

## Hackathon Highlights

1. **Duration**: 3 Days â€“ enough time to explore, innovate, and implement.
2. **Selection**: Choose from over 30 distinct kits.
3. **Innovation**: Pivot original kits to conceive a two-part problem-solving solution.
4. **Structure**: Develop a frontend prototype using Streamlit and a backend comprising at least 2 independently containerized services, each with its FastAPI endpoints.

## Team Up!

Whether you're a solo developer or part of a multi-member powerhouse, teams can vary in size. However, ensure you align with the specific rules of your chosen hackathon.

- Architecting a backend with 2+ containerized services and their corresponding FastAPI endpoints.

## A Glimpse into "How it's Made with Intel"

This remarkable code base encapsulates distinct product lifecycle components transitioned from legacy to modern machine learning solutions, powered by Intel's robust AI hardware and software stack. Witness a journey from individual AI Reference Kits to an interconnected pseudo-microservice architecture, making integration into multifaceted applications a breeze.

**Demo Code Snapshot**: Explore a sample that integrates demand prediction, predictive maintenance, customer support chatbot, and visual QA/QC reference kits. These are refactored into pseudo-microservices crafted for a pharmaceutical product lifecycle narrative, complete with a Streamlit frontend. Use this as your architectural muse!

**Note**: Remember, this is a "hackathon out of the box". While it serves as a fantastic starting point, always refer to your specific hackathon's official rules for detailed guidelines.
