# Intel AI Reference Kit "Prototyping Challenge"

The AI Reference Kit Prototyping Challenge allows developers to compete and learn how to build practical AI applications using intel-optimized software on intel hardware platforms.  In this challenge, you assume the persona of a ‚ÄúConsulting AI Developer,‚Äù you are tasked with delivering a prototype application to a technology review board in just a few days.  The application must meet the following requirements:
- Must include at least one modular AI services based on a unique AI Reference Kit
- All functionality must be accessible and functional through a Streamlit frontend
  - Frontend must communicate with the backend through a REST API framework, using HTTP Protocols
- All solution components must run in their own docker container as modular services
- Entire prototype must run on the Intel 4th Generation Xeon resources provided through the Intel Developer Cloud

# What are AI Reference Kits? 
In collaboration with Accenture*, Intel offers a series of downloadable AI reference kits to the open-source community to help enterprises accelerate their digital transformation journey. These kits are built upon the AI application tools that Intel provides to data scientists and developers.

**Example Solution**: Take the predictive maintenance for telephone lines and visual QA/QC reference kits, and transform them into a robotic arm maintenance combined with a product-specific visual QA/QC tool, aiming to revolutionize production line automation.

## Hackathon Highlights

1. **Duration**: 3 Days ‚Äì enough time to explore, innovate, and implement.
2. **Selection**: Choose from over 30 distinct kits.
3. **Innovation**: Pivot original kits to conceive a problem-solving solution.
4. **Structure**: Develop a frontend prototype using Streamlit and a backend comprising at least 12 independently containerized service, each with its FastAPI endpoints.

## Team Up!

Whether you're a solo developer or part of a multi-member powerhouse, teams can vary in size. However, ensure you align with the specific rules of your chosen hackathon.

## Judging Criteria

What participants will submit:
- 60 second video walkthrough of their solution
- Link to Open GitHub Codebase
    - README with a more detailed dsecription of the solution
    - Entire codebase that supports the solution
- 3-4 Sentence Description of Solution

What will Impress Judges:
- Your ability to pivot original kits creatively.
- Building a frontend using Streamlit.
- Architecting a backend with 2+ containerized services and their corresponding FastAPI endpoints.

## Judging Process and Criteria

1. Community Judging Round: After submitting solutions through the dedicated discord channel, other developers and intel experts can vote on their favorite solutions. Developers have unlimited votes, so we recommend only voting for your favorite solutions. Votes are issues by giving a reaction to the solutions post. One reaction is equal to one point.
2. Top 5 Judging by Intel Panel: The five solutions with the highest number of votes at the deadline of the community judging round will be evaluated in more detail over the next 24-48 hours by a panel of Intel judges. Below are the criteria that will be used in this round of judging.

## A Glimpse into the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Business "AI Reference Kit Prototype" Codebase

**Sample Prototype**: Explore a sample that integrates demand prediction, predictive maintenance, customer support chatbot, and visual QA/QC reference kits. These are refactored into pseudo-microservices crafted for a pharmaceutical product lifecycle narrative, complete with a Streamlit frontend. Use this as your architectural muse!

**Note**: Remember, this is a "hackathon out of the box". While it serves as a fantastic starting point, always refer to your specific hackathon's official rules for detailed guidelines.
